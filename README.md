# easyMissionaryBlog
A fun little project I'll start working on in the next few months. The plan is to receive an email and then post the text and included images to a blog that will automatically be created while a missionary is on their mission. With no work, they will automatically have all of their experiences saved in a nice format to access after the mission.
